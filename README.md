# TopicModelingEnronEmails
This is an exploration of Topic Modeling techniques, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-negative Matrix Factorization using the Enron Email Dataset

The Enron Dataset was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bag+of+words.

Inpsiration for the code and approach for LDA and NMF was found in this article: https://medium.com/mlreview/topic-modeling-with-scikit-learn-e80d33668730.

Very a very similar approach is shown in the Scikit Learn tutorial: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html.
